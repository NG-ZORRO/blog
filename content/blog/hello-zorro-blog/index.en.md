**From now on, we will use [the blog which you're reading](https://ng.ant.design/blog) as our main channel for publishing dev blogs, release notes and knowledge sharing. [Our old stories published on Medium](https://medium.com/ng-zorro) would be migrated here gradually.**

We made the decision for the following reasons:

### Open

Say good by to Medium.

* **Source code of this blog and all posts are open**. Anyone have access to them at anytime, anywhere.
* **Users don't need to register to join in discussions.**
* Users could subscribe using RSS.
* Friends from community could contribute to our blog in an open and convenient way.

### Improved Reading Experience

* **The build-in Dark Mode** could protect your eyes in dimmed environments.
* **Multi languages supported!**. Readers could select a language that they find most comfortable with, even contribute to the translations.
* In the future, users could explore old blog by categories or tags.

### Better Writing and Maintaining Experience

* Get rid of the horrible editor of Medium! Writes could leverage markdown to enjoy writing!
* Google Analytics could help us have a better understanding of users' behaviour, so we could provide better service to users and power up the development of our projects.
